Welcome to my site! 

My name is Rene Raggl and I was born and grew up in the mountains of Tirol, Austria. Since then, I have seen a bit of the world out there and am curious to learn more.

My main interests are minimalism, technology, photography, literature, stationary (I rarely go anywhere without a planner and a good pen), music and travel. Not necessarily in this order.

I try to enjoy the simple things in life and can generally be described as a cheerful and reliable good guy.

"The only honorable way to live in this world is to be who you pretend to be."

My motto, stolen from a guy named Socrates.
