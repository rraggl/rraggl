So, let's get it out of the way at the very beginning: this is a story about me and how I am trying to cope with the current quite difficult situation I am in.

Since about 3-4 weeks I can call myself an "aspiring minimalist". And while some of you might think that I have now lost my marbles altogether, I kindly ask you to grab a cup of tea, maybe a small bite and then sit down and bear with me for while. This will be a longer one...

As I posted earlier, I am currently out there looking for new employment, or rather a new mission, I'd say.

Since starting my career in 2001, I have usually worked as (Key) Account Manager / Area Manager / Export manager in different industries and almost all of them were rather high-paying jobs.

Only two of them actually really brought me joy, but as I had money to burn and was credit "worthy" I could and would splurge and always buy the latest gadgets from Smartphones, to Computers, Tablets, Cameras,  etc. etc. to fill up the void. Fooling myself, is what I call it now.





I believed it would make me happy and loved and admired, like the advertisments promised.

Well, it did not and they are all liars, but stunningly enough we appear to trust those marketing guys deeply. I still felt empty and unfulfilled and with loosing the last job I really loved in 2014, I felt I had no aim anymore, nothing to strive for. So I sought comfort in food and over eating (which I had been prone to before).  And I started purchasing even more stuff.



So, how did I get into this "minimalism" thing?

Living from unemployment benefits I can still pay the bills, but it is not exactly royal, so I was scouring the Internet for tips and tricks to save money. So far so good and nothing unusual, I would guess.

During one of those evenings browsing YouTube, I came across a Video called "The story of stuff":

and while I subcosciously or not knew about all the things that were mentioned there, I have always been ignoring them. But this time the message rang a bell. A small and quiet one, but one that I could not unhear. It finally made sense. All of it.

Once I had found this movie I watched the others on the channel, covering the idiocy of drinking bottled water, the insanity of cosmetics and fashion as well as the cost of the electronics that I cherished so much only months ago.

One video led to the next and I ended up watching pretty much all documentaries that were there about the excessive consumerism society that we live in today. That was the link to some more videos and blogs that were talking about something that seems to offer a way out of it: minimalism or simple living.

And that strung a chord with me. No, not the guys that were saying that ideally you own 100 things or less. (At least I am not there yet.)

But people like Leo Babauta (whom I have read earlier for his productivity tips) and Joshua Fields Millburn and his friend Ryan Nicodemus did have a message that I could use for my own purposes. Less is more. Enough is good.

So, here with these lines, I try to convey what minimalism means to me, the definition I have prepared for myself for the time being. And my sincere apologies if it sounds confusing, but as Albert Einstein once said:

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it good enough."

which definetly holds true for me in this case. I do still have a lot to learn.

"Eliminate from my life all the things that I do not use regularly (=stuff) and by this free up time and resources to enjoy the experiences, people and yes, I admit, things that really mean something to me."

Under this guiding line, I started tossing all the really useless stuff. Not with a packing party (this would just drive me mad, having to search for everything all the time), but I started with a small drawer in my office and went from there to the next drawer, to my office bookcase to my bathroom, to my bedroom and so on until I had done the whole house about a week ago. The result?

- 10 60 Liter bags of unfitting / ugly (in my view, most of it was still as new) / unwanted clothing were donated to the Salvation Army or the Refugee Center here on the island

- 16 large moving boxes filled with everything from kitchen utensils, to old Laptops and Smartphones, Playstation, Games, Books, childhood toys etc. etc. etc. Either given to friends and neighbours or sold off (with little success) or given to the local "Kringloopwinkel" (= thrift shop).

    That is just one example...

One "condition" for me was that I would throw away as little as possible, so last Friday I jammed my car full with all the stuff I could not sell after two weeks and brought everything to the local thrift shop. The only thing I asked them in return is to put aside nice LPs / Minidiscs - music being one of those "things" that have real value for me - if they get them and that was fine with them.

Yes I know, I could use Spotify, Google Play Music, MP3s etc. and I have in the past, but right now I prefer physically owning the music over the monthly payments that come with those services and my preferred medium for this is the Minidisc.

And I am not done yet, this was only the first wave of purging everything that is unneeded. I doubt though, that I will ever get below 1.000 or even 500 items. At least with how things are now. I live alone in a rather large house (for Dutch terms) and I would hate it to be so empty as not to have a soul anymore.

Now, how does it feel? Well, actually I felt anxious on one side ("What if I do need it again?") and really liberated on the other. There are corners in my house that I can now finally reach for cleaning. And not only the physical clutter is gone, the clutter in my brain, the mental stress caused by the physical belongings is gone with it. I can finally find things that I need, because they are no longer buried under the stuff.

I realize that I still have a looong way to go, but I am making steps in a direction that feels right.

The first goal, now that the clutter is out of the way is to get rid of my debt - not overly huge, but still unpleasant -  that I accumulated by falling for those false promises and start working towards a future with less worries. Be it about things weighing me down or companies wanting money from me.

Sure, a luxury problem, as I don't need to worry about a roof over my head and sufficient food for the time being etc. but still one that needs to be solved.

I firmly believe that I am not the only one in such a situation and that there are other people all over the world who are looking for a way out. And like Foreigner writes "There's no easy way out, no shortcut home", but I will get there or die trying.

So, in the coming weeks I will share with you how I am doing in this endeavour and what tips and tricks I have already come across. And I'll keep them shorter than this. Pathfinders promise!
