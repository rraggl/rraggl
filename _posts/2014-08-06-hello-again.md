After an absence of more than three years, I decided to take up blogging again. It has been a while and I decided to tackle it differently this time. Instead of a souped up diary, I will try to share my insights regarding Technology, the Internet, Products, Travel, Photography as well as Business and hope that at least some of you out there may profit from it.

I will also regularly review things I own and how they fit the bigger picture in my life. I will show you my struggle against overweight and other obstacles and all the other insanities of modern life. From time to time I will share interesting posts from other people like the inspiring Leo Babauta, Trey Ractliff, Justine Ezarik (aka iJustine) or Marquess Brownlee.

The intention is to do this in a fun, yet honest way (which is why I chose the name “Gi Shin” for this blog, which is Japanese and means “Righteousness” and “Sincerety”). If I should gain enough traction with this to be able and do sponsored reviews, I will tell you so. If I don’t like something, I will tell you. All questions shall be answered to the best of my abilities. That’s a promise! 😉

So, I hope you will enjoy the future reading and if you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to let me know!

Yours, sincerely,

Rene
