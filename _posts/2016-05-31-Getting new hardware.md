I am writing this on a 2009 MacBook Pro with a 2,2 Ghz Intel Core2Duo. I inherited it from my father and it does have a lot of sentimental value for me. I can still remember how excited he was when he first showed it to me.

Being objective, however, this one is certainly past it's prime. Many would call it a dinosaur. No longer worth using. However, it still manages to start up in less than 30 seconds and is more than sufficient for most tasks and even games like Starcraft II, Diablo III or World of Tanks Blitz. And it is still running the latest version of OS X. Admitted, I upgraded it with a 240 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM, but the rest is still vintage 2009.

Why do I bring this up? I am currently pursuing a certification as a Linux System Administrator and by mentioning this on Twitter I got offered the opportunity by opensource.com to tell my story at: https://opensource.com/life/16/5/my-linux-story-rene-raggl

This in turn, got me in contact with Pierce Tyler, who interviewed me for the xTuple Blog, the results of which you can find here: https://xtuple.com/blog/ptyler/how-this-open-source-aficionado-got-his-start-with-xtuple

All those conversations made me realize that I did not use Linux as much as I wanted to or as much as I should if I want to get into this. Now, currently I do run a VM with Ubuntu 14.04.03. However, it happens quite frequently that the VM is asking too much from the processor and the screen goes dark on me. Sometimes for a minute or two and as you will realize, this is not a workable situation. While I strived to do most of my daily work in the VM, due to this performance problem, I noticed that over time my work was shifting back to OS X, which did not (yet) show such problems. Or better said, the "thinking pauses" were limited to a couple of seconds, which was much more acceptable.

So I started looking around for something new. My first choice would have been the Librem 13 by Purism closely followed by the System76 Lemur 14". However, both are way above my budget. Let's just say I am somewhat "constricted" for the time being, as I am still out of a job. And they both would come with US keyboards, which is very annoying for me as I have been typing on German QWERTZ keyboards for more than 25 years now. (Gee, I am really getting old...)

So I would have to look closer to home and for something second-hand. If I had to choose, Lenovo would be my first and only choice as my previous experiences with them were really good. I liked their robustness, the modularity and the fact that they offer docks. My budget was set to be a max of 400,- Euros. Quite quickly I set my sights on the T430s i5, which were going for prices between 250,- and 400,- Euros. And even though the Dutch laptops would come with a QWERTY keyboard, I could easily replace that with a QWERTZ one off eBay for less than 40,- Euros. I picked one up at tweedehandslaptop.nl for 349,- which arrived the day after I ordered it. While the external condition was as described, the promise of 100 % technical functionality was not kept: the AC socket on the laptop was busted, the battery only delivered about one hour of operational time and the installed Windows 7 Pro image was somehow broken.

So while I REALLY liked the Laptop itself, while I had filed the complaint with tweedehandslaptop.nl, doubts started to crawl through my gut. I was about to pay 349,- Euros because I couldn't wait for a minute for my computer to finish what I had asked him to do. A computer that was perfectly fine for the rest. So in keeping with the whole Minimalism thing I am going through I will keep using this Laptop until it really gives out or once it does not receive security updates anymore.

I just wrote the mail to tweedehandslaptop.nl that I want to undo the purchase and asked them to give me back my money, which they accepted without further ado. Aside from the lacking shipping control on the T430s, their service was spot on. So I'll be certain to come back to them, when the time comes.

I will use the Linux VM for my course and will have to do the daily tasks on OS X and there is no shame in that. It's what I have at the moment and I'll have to make do.
