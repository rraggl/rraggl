Dear all,

I write this update to tell you that within the next week, I will shut down my LinkedIn account. I really valued our connections here, but I can't keep doing this with a clean conscience. For the few of you who haven't already moved on to the next post, I'll gladly explain why:

**Reason No 1:**
I don't trust them anymore. After the takeover by Microsoft and the huge hack that came to light in May this year, my trust in LinkedIn has gone: https://www.troyhunt.com/observations-and-thoughts-on-the-linkedin-data-breach

And as some of you know, I have been getting more and more serious with data security and privacy in the last few months, so to me this is a huge thing. It may not be to you, as you are still with the "I got nothing to hide crowd", but maybe someday you will change your mind.

I firmly believe that no single company should have as much information (remember: knowledge is power) over people like Microsoft does now.
Especially considering that they run the OS with the biggest market share in SMB and consumer markets and will happily use it to spy on its users.

Remember this? http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/01/microsoft_gets_creepy_with_win10/

And as you may or may not know, they recently not only took over LinkedIn, but also Sunrise Calendar and the Wunderlist to-do manager. (I would not be surprised if they were looking to take over Evernote too.) This means they know what appointments people have, what they got to do, where they are at which time and who their business connection is.  

Also, I value my business connections tremendously. Some of them brought me to where I am now and you have all influenced me, my career and even my life in one way or the other.

I am deeply grateful for that. Therefore, I go to great lenghts to protect your data. So should LinkedIn / Microsoft. But we all know that Microsoft has a far less than perfect scorecard on this subject.

In short: your business is too valuable for me to trust LinkedIn with your and my data and conversations.

**Reason No 2:**
I have always only used it more like a modern-day Rolodex: a place where I keep my business contact data. And as you did all the work of entering your contact information, I did not have to. (I am lazy that way.) I now did an export of all my contacts here to an Excel file and have your contact information, so we can be in touch whenever we like, by mail, phone or mail.

By the way, if you find this creepy that I now got your (often personal) mail address, it's very easy and LinkedIn will say it's a feature and not a bug. You just go to your connections and in the lower right corner you will find a small link that says "Export connections" and from there you can easily can get a .csv file with all the data.
Don't worry, I was responsible in dealing with our business together and I will responsibly handle your data.

**Reason No 3:**
The quality of the content on LinkedIn (at least the part that I get to see) has been vastly deteriorating in the last half year. Math tests, logical thinking tests, veteran honeration memes, touching stories have been flooding my timeline. There is nothing wrong with that content in itself, please don't get me wrong. It isn't abusive, offensive or in any other way wrong.

However, **IT'S IN THE WRONG F-BEEP-ING PLACE!** (My sincere apologies, I don't usually use the f-word, but this really makes me hopping mad...)

People don't seem to understand that LinkedIn is a place for business. At least that was the way it was intended and that is how many people want to use it. So articles should be strictly business related. Maybe they just forget or get carried away.

Personal feelings, stories, memes and tests already do have a place: it is called Facebook.
(Which I also left some time ago, with similar reasons. You can read that here: 
http://rene.raggl.me/internet/2015/08/06/Goodbye-Facebook/)

It has become so bad that aside from the use as a Rolodex, LinkedIn adds no more value for me.

And what do you do in business if something costs more (see Reason 1) than it yields? You get rid of it.

A sound and straight-forward business decision.

**How to get in touch**

Again, like I said, I value the relations with all 475 of you. And I would like to stay in touch. So, you can reach me by one of the following after the account is deactivated:

– Website: http://rene.raggl.me
– E-Mail: rene at raggl.me
– Twitter: https://twitter.com/rraggl

If one of you would like to have my (snail)mail address or my telephone number, please send me a message and I'll be glad to reply.

Hope to hear from some of you in the future!
