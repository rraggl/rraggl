Let me start this by saying that I used to be somebody who bought new (smart)phones at least every twelve months and that – if I did not miscount – I have owned 42 telephones since I got my first Nokia 1611 in 1998. To save you the maths, this is almost 2,5 phones per year. So that is where the “Gadget Guy” part comes in. And this madness has to stop.

Sunday evening as I stepped into the car to drive home, my radio was tuned in to 3FM as usual and the program on it was the one of Joram Kaat.

And he was talking about something that actually had kept me busy for some time now: how he is obsessed and preoccupied with his smartphone. He wanted to put up 10 tips to use your smartphone sensibly and I offered him what I have been doing for the last ca. 1-2 months: I use a dumbphone from 2006 and I actually like it quite a lot. (I don’t see the point to use a smartphone just to remove all apps on it.)

I texted this to the stations number and very much to my surprise I got called back within a few minutes, after a few basic questions I was directly on air for the show. You can find the record here: http://www.3fm.nl/a/ug/359107 (My part starts after around 1:18:00.)

So, now that the bragging is out of the way, I would like to explain in more detail what this is about for me:

Before all, this is about freedom.
Freedom from (useless) information overflow.
Freedom from attention-diverting alerts and messages.
Freedom from an oppressive contract.
Freedom to spend time with your friends like you want to. Not when your device coincidentally gives you some time without going “Ping” in your pocket and takes you out of the moment.
Freedom to not being constantly monitored by Google, Facebook et al. on which sites you visit, which apps you use and where you are going.
Freedom of fear that it might break. (Because a smartphone would be expensive to replace.)
Freedom of fear that the battery won’t last.

As you may have guessed, I also used to be one of those specimens of the human race that was buried in their smartphone whenever a free moment popped up or when the conversation was not really all that interesting. I depised that of myself. So I have been trying this on and off again for the last 12 months. Around Christmas 2014 I took 3 weeks off my smartphone and then again for two weeks in May. Now I started again, about mid september and stuck to it.

It even goes as far that as I took out my Galaxy Note 3 recently to try it again for feel I put it back immediately: I was greeted by a bombardment of updates, messages and permission requests and what not. And I realized that I really no longer want to put up with this. My old trusty SonyEricsson K770i (pictured above) is beautiful (to me), sleek, cheap, sturdy and simple to use. Ok, it would be great to have a better camera on this thing (it does have a 3MP shooter of mediocre quality), but that is my only complaint. The K770i is actually the only one of the devices that I have always kept, initially as an emergency backup-phone.

But the main thing the dumbphone gives me is peace of mind. I really am only called for urgent things and am not bombarded with actually unnecessary information.

And if it breaks, I can get the next one from the Internet for 20-40 Euros. This way I will contribute to keeping at least one phone from the e-Waste scrapheaps in the third world, poisoning people. (As you have read above, I have a LOT to make up for. I know, I really do. But one has to start somewhere, no?)

The next step will be to cancel my contract. At the moment, I am still tied to a contract until June 2016, for which I pay about 38,- Euros per month. I intend to cancel it as soon as I get the chance and switch to a cheaper SIM-only offer which will cost me less then half of that and allows me to cancel it anytime I want to.

And last but not least, as they say in the viral YouTube Video by Gary Turk called “Look Up”: smart phones and dumb people.

By the way, the Note 3 is for sale with a whole bunch of accessories, so if you are interested, feel free to head over to Marktplaats and check it out. It served me well and is a great device in itself, but I do not longer want to live this way. And because living on unemployment pay, I can use every Euro I can get.
