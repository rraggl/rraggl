Good Morning!

As of today, my contract for broadband home Internet is cancelled. I actually cancelled the contract earlier, but there is a one month delay before they actually cut you off.

It is weird to actually write about that, but Internet has become so omni-present in our lives that it is deemed to be a basic human right. For most it is unimaginable not to have Internet access at home.

Well, why would I then make this dumb-ass move, you ask? As I wrote earlier, I am currently without a job and still have nothing really promising in sight. I don't know what it is with employers now. But to further cut back on my expenses, the 35,- Euros / month that Internet costs me is one of the larger positions still left on my monthly bills. Together with cancelling that and some other non-necessary monthly spending (two insurances and a reduction on my cell phone plan), I was able to shave another 110,- Euros off my expenses. I actually should have done that earlier, but then again, I thought I would find work much earlier.

So, how will I get by? How will I live? Most applications are done online. Taxes are done online, almost all communication nowadays is done online. And I am not (yet) a hermit, but I need to cut costs. Well, again, somebody else delivered the inspiration: http://www.theminimalists.com/internet/

After ruminating on this for a while, I thought "I can do this!" There are plenty of public WiFi spots available here: in the library (which is really cozy), in Caf√©'s in public areas and in a real pinch I could drop in at friends to "loan" their Internet connection.

To do this with (relative) safety, however, I need a VPN service. After doing some research I decided to go for http://www.cyberghostvpn.com and did not regret it yet. It supports all my devices and seems not to have a very negative effect on the connection speed. The price of 70,- something Euros for two years was reasonable too.

However, most of my day to day browsing and e-Mailing will be done by using my mobile phone. "What?" you will say, "You just wrote in an article last year that you recommend against smartphones!" (http://rene.raggl.me/jekyll/pixyll/2015/11/03/My-take-on-dumbphones/)

True. But as almost everything in life, things are not black and white here. While I detest the way that they are making us ever more unsocial, I am fully aware of the usefulness of the tool "Smartphone".

My contract extension with T-Mobile Netherlands was coming up and I decided to pick one of their new contracts which you can adjust up or down as you need. The basic one with unlimited calls / texts and 3 GB of data turned out to be almost 15,- Euros cheaper than my current one which only has 1 GB, so that can't be bad. So I went for that and picked up an iPhone 6 128 GB with that. All with abandoning home Internet in mind: I could keep all my music and data on my phone and still use it to tether my iPad or Laptop to for browsing and e-Mailing.

I still have turned off almost all notifications and don't have push e-Mail enabled. Instead I pull messages every three hours from 07:00 to 21:00. And that really helps battery life too.

In preparation for my "offline" life, I also recorded a lot of music to MiniDisc, bought a DVD player at the thrift store and picked up a bunch of DVDs for 1,- Euro apiece from the Dutch version of Craigslist. And I will have a lot more time to read, so I'll spend a lot of time at the library anyway.

Now I only need to get my record player fixed.

Of course I will keep you posted on how I'll do, living most of the time offline.
Write to you soon!
