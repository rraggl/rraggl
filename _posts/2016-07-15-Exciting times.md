At the time of my last post I was still struggling with finding a new job. Things have changed tremendously since then. To make it as short as possible: in June I was planning to get started as a
freelancer, as apparently nobody was going to hire me. And one is the master of his own lot. Right? I was going to go into IT, which was the obvious choice for me. My business would be focused on offering IT services for small and medium businesses in the region. As many of those are still using Excel to run their business as well as @hotmail.com or @gmail.com adresses, there should have been enough business around. I have invested a lot of time to figure out what is out there in affordable yet professional software and SaaS solutions. This was going to be my capital.

However, this got cut short on the very last possible moment, as I got the phone call that I could come over to sign a contract with http://www.bonusan.com so there you go: this is how the fates can twist on you. One moment, you are planning to freelance because you have no other options left and in the next, you get to sign with a really great company that offers you the warmest welcome that you ever had at a new job.

So that's that. If you remember, I was also mulling over replacing the 2009 MBP that I got with a Lenovo T430s. Due to the fact that I was planning to start my own business and Apples announcement that the new macOS Sierra would no longer support the 2009 series of machines, I had to make the leap. I found a good offer over at http://www.e-trend.nl and this time around, the Laptop was in great shape, like new almost.

So I went to work and can now this beast of a machine my own: 16 GB RAM / 1x 480 GB SSD / 1x 240 GB SSD and a Dock (one of the main points why I like the Thinkpad series). It is an absolute joy to work with this thing! The processor might be 3 generations behind by now but I find it very hard to notice anything. And it IS a huge improvement over the MacBook. Like I wrote earlier, it was workable, but certainly no speed champ and gaming was pretty much out of the question.

Initially I set it up with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the GNOME shell, but about a month in I got drawn in more and more by Fedora, as I read multiple reviews that it is more or less the ultimate GNOME distro. I was quite hesitant due to the fact that I was very much used to how apt / apt-get work. I had never seriously tried anything else. Still, after some duckduckgoing (no, that's not a typo) around, I made a USB stick with Fedora 24 workstation and installed it. It now has been two weeks or so and I have to say that I really, REALLY like it. No, I love it to pieces. It's fast. It's easy and looks great too. And it seriously surprised me that I like the dnf package manager even better than apt-get. Who would have thought? It is much better in displaying what is going on and the command syntax is VERY similar. In contrast, apt-get seems rather messy. I know it isn't, but dnf presents itself just so much better. 

Oh, and I got a home server. Now you might say "What? Last month you say you're living on benefits and now you buy two new machines?". Yep. If you still need proof that Linux is excellent at running on older hardware then check this out: I picked up a used Lenovo M58 on http://www.marktplaats.nl (IntelCore2Duo, 4 GB RAM, 80 GB HDD) for the horrendous sum of 40,- Euros including shipping. I chose this computer because of it's compact form factor and that it fits into my electronics closet, where the router etc. is located too. I installed Fedora 24 Server on it and it just works. One might even call it "zippy"! Also I honestly LOVE the Cockpit remote management tool! I intend to set it up with OwnCloud and make it my home media server, but that is probably something more suitable for the stormy gray days in fall.

With that, my Raspberry Pi 2 comes off it's temporary duty as OwnCloud server. So, now to find a new use for it... I am open to suggestions!

Seriously, recently I feel that I might be taking on more than I can chew, but all those projects are so damn interesting.
