Good Morning!

As of today, my contract for broadband home Internet is cancelled. I actually cancelled the contract earlier, but there is a one month delay before they actually cut you off.

It is weird to actually write about that, but Internet has become so omni-present in our lives that it is deemed to be a basic human right. For most it is unimaginable not to have Internet access at home.

Well, why would I then make this dumb-ass move, you ask? As I wrote earlier, I am currently without a job and still have nothing really promising in sight. I don't know what it is with employers now. But to further cut back on my expenses, the 35,- Euros / month that Internet costs me is one of the larger positions still left on my monthly bills. Together with cancelling that and some other non-necessary monthly spending (two insurances and a reduction on my cell phone plan), I was able to shave another 110,- Euros off my expenses. I actually should have done that earlier, but then again, I thought I would find work much earlier.

So, how will I get by? How will I live? Most applications are done online. Taxes are done online, almost all communication nowadays is done online. And I am not (yet) a hermit, but I need to cut costs. Well, again, somebody else delivered the inspiration: http://www.theminimalists.com/internet/

After ruminating on this for a while, I thought "I can do this!" There are plenty of public WiFi spots available here: in the library (which is really cozy), in Café's in public areas and in a real pinch I could drop in at friends to "loan" their Internet connection.

To do this with (relative) safety, however, I need a VPN service. After doing some research I decided to go for http://www.cyberghostvpn.com and did not regret it yet. It supports all my devices and seems not to have a very negative effect on the connection speed. The price of 70,- something Euros for two years was reasonable too.

However, most of my day to day browsing and e-Mailing will be done by using my mobile phone. "What?" you will say, "You just wrote in an article last year that you recommend against smartphones!" (http://rene.raggl.me/jekyll/pixyll/2015/11/03/My-take-on-dumbphones/)

True. But as almost everything in life, things are not black and white here. While I detest the way that they are making us ever more unsocial, I am fully aware of the usefulness of the tool "Smartphone".

My contract extension with T-Mobile Netherlands was coming up and I decided to pick one of their new contracts which you can adjust up or down as you need. The basic one with unlimited calls / texts and 3 GB of data turned out to be almost 15,- Euros cheaper than my current one which only has 1 GB, so that can't be bad. So I went for that and picked up an iPhone 6 128 GB with that. All with abandoning home Internet in mind: I could keep all my music and data on my phone and still use it to tether my iPad or Laptop to for browsing and e-Mailing.

I still have turned off almost all notifications and don't have push e-Mail enabled. Instead I pull messages every three hours from 07:00 to 21:00. And that really helps battery life too.

In preparation for my "offline" life, I also recorded a lot of music to MiniDisc, bought a DVD player at the thrift store and picked up a bunch of DVDs for 1,- Euro apiece from the Dutch version of Craigslist. For the rest I'll rely on being able to lend DVDs from the library, which does have an extensive and ever changing catalogue. And I will have a lot more time to read, so I'll spend a lot of time at the library anyway.

Now I only need to get my record player fixed.

Of course I will keep you posted on how I'll do, living most of the time offline.
Write to you soon!
