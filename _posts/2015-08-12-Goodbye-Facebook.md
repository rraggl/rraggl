As of last Friday I do not own a computer in the traditional sense anymore.

I am writing these lines on my iPad Air through a Bluetooth keyboard, while listening to some soothing blues on the record player on my desk. My iPad is the only real computing device left in my house. And it feels like the right thing to do.

“Are you nuts?” you may ask. Well, maybe, but let me take you on the journey that led me here. It starts out a little bit like the story of Paul Miller from THE VERGE, but it is founded on completely different reasons. And I did not go offline completely, nor do I intend to for the time being.

I try to stem the tidal wave of superflous information and attention diverting notifications that we all are subjected to on a daily basis. It drove me nuts and I did no longer want to put up with this. I try to focus on what is important to ME and not what others think I should read. But let’s start at the beginning:

Pretty much since I can remember, I had a computer. It all started with one of those kids learning computers. It was called the SPIELMASTER. (Yes, that name was cool back then. Can we move on now?).

Shortly after that followed a Commodore C64 with Datasette, which mostly was used for playing games, my favorites being Turrican, Rambo, Arachnophobia and a sort of 4-in-a-row game (where you were shooting your enemies with lasers) the name of which I can’t remember.

My first “real” computer was an Apple Performa 400 bought somewhere 1993/94. Since then I have been mostly using Apple Computers and quite a bunch of them too.

Back in those days, most people would have described me as a pure blooded “Gadget-Man”. Heck, I was even mentioned as such in my Yearbook entry and rightfully so. Because aside from computers, I have been attracted to all kinds of electronic circuitry starting in an early age. I owned countless (smart)phones, Organizers and PDA’s. I was the first in my class to own a cellphone and the first in my friend circle to own a PDA. Hardly a year passed where I wouldn’t buy a new phone.

This passion continued until about six months ago. The sudden death of my father in may last year coinciding with the loss of a beloved aunt and loosing my dream job all within about a month turned my life upside down. After processing the initial shock, I still kept buying gadgets (which for me is also kind of a comforting act), but all of a sudden, the act seemed hollow, shallow and not satisfying anymore. I started seriously questioning this behaviour.

I took a good long hard look at my life the last few months and realized that I was ever more stressed out. I did not seem to be able to find a single quiet minute for myself. I realized that a lot of this is caused by the constant availability brought on by my devices. Mr. Ivan Pavlov would have a good long laugh if he could see my reaction whenever I heard something go “PING” anywhere…

So starting two months ago, bit by bit I started to eliminate the stress factors from my life:

    I stopped reading the news, which most of the time is exclusively negative anyway.
    I cancelled all newsletters and RSS feeds.
    I turned off notifications for almost all apps on my iPad.
    I sold superflous stuff that demanded care, time and attention and that I was hardly using anyway. (Still ongoing.)
    I started to work towards reducing my debt.
    Since almost four weeks I am living without smartphone. (ok, it is still in a drawer, just in case…)
    And now as one of the final steps in this plan, I sold my iMac last Friday.

You’re never gonna guess what comes next!

It feels great!
Usually, I’d spend the weekend playing Starcraft II for the millionth time using cheats, trying to figure out more creative ways to lay ambush to those pixel soldiers. Or spend money on renting a movie etc. In fact, I hardly ever would do something really productive with this admittedly awesome machine.

So, what changed because of that?

First off, it somehow feels like an enormous, gigantic burden is gone. I can’t yet tell where this comes from, but that’s how it is.

This weekend I slept in, but yet I had enough time to spend it cleaning up around the house, check off some long overdue household tasks, changing light fixtures, unclogging the drain and generally plan through my next steps.

The changes mentioned above are also saving me quite a bit of money already and I am looking to expand on this. For example, I had hardly realized how many subscriptions I had racked up just by using the computer in the past. All together they amounted to over 100,- Euros / month. Now I am down to 8,- Euros / month and I think I can live with those. (One is for extra storage on Google drive, the other for iCloud.)

Like I wrote above, I don’t want to eschew all modern things or the internet, but instead I put in an effort to live the post-PC era and center my workflows around the data and not on the devices I am using. I want to focus on the things that have value to me. Like my sanity for example.

Some of those things will most certainly lead to me being labelled “Hipster”, “Retro” or “just trying to go against the stream”.

I will write more about those things later and how I use / value them, but for the time being we could say that I am going from “Gadget-Man” to “Retro-Man” and that is not just for the sake of it.

See you later!
