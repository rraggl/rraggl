Sorry, Mr. Zuckerberg, things will simply not work out between the two of us. I simply cannot agree with your business ethics about selling and using conversations that you lead people to believe are private for your own purposes and for advertising revenue.

I know you could not care less about what I think. But I believe what you do is not right and hence have to draw my conclusion. That is one liberty you have not yet taken away – even though you try by employing peer pressure, social engineering and by making it difficult on purpose to quit your service.

See below my last Facebook post. I will hit that “Delete Account” tomorrow evening. And I will not go back.

    As some of you know, I already had left Facebook and I’ll be doing it again. For the same reason: Privacy.

    There simply is no other company in this world who handles your date more recklessly than Facebook does. Google does it on a grander scale, but they are more transparent in their communication. Until now…

    Many of you might now say: “I have nothing to hide.” I fully believe that, else you would not be my friends here.

    But privacy is not only about keeping private stuff private.

    This is about something far more valuable than this: freedom. The freedom to use the internet without having to look over your shoulder all the time. Without having to ask yourself “Who can see this?”. To express what you think without having to fear it will be held against you.

    That is a freedom that people have fought and paid for with blood, sweat and tears since times immortal.

    And what do we do? Throw it all away. For convenience.

    The convenience to share our experiences with our dear ones, friends and acquaintances.

    Wait a minute, didn’t we do this before FB too? No? By letter, postcard, telephone or E-Mail. Or private messaging services like Telegram. (And please don’t get me started on WhatsApp!)

    It’s still possible today, but the question is if we have become too lazy or not to stay in touch with people we care about the normal way.

    After I hit the deactivate button tomorrow evening, my Account will go on “hibernate” mode for 14 days. (Of course they don’t let you cancel it straight away. Figures…)

    So feel free to leave your parting thoughts, rants or whatever moves you and comments for the time being.

    After tomorrow evening you will be able to reach me using one of the following methods:

    – Website: http://rene.raggl.me
    – E-Mail: rene at raggl.me
    – Twitter: @rraggl

    If one of you would like to have my (snail)mail addres or my telephone number, please send me a private message before tomorrow evening.

    Hope to hear from some of you in the future!

    So long!
