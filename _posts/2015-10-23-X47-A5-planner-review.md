A few months back I was contacted by the owner of X47 regarding my earlier review of the X47 Uno wallet. He had seen it, liked it and asked me if there were any other X47 (http://www.x47.de) products that I would like to review.

Well, there was this weakness that I have had for their A5 Planner and very much to my surprise, he agreed to send me one unit for review. I am sorry that it took me so long to get around to it, but I finally managed to make a video of it and upload it to YouTube. Thank you very much for the opportunity, Mr. Büttner!

To sum up my video, I can say that as usual from X47 the leather quality is absolutely astonishing. The review unit came in the black CLASSIC leather variant which is very smooth and simplistic, which I like a lot, really. But my favourite will always remain the Gaucho Mahagoni leather. However, I must emphasize that is really personal preference, the quality itself seeks it’s equal in either variant and is even better than the Filofax Kendal A5 that I am also using from time to time.

The X47 system with the spring loaded rod insert system is very well-engineered and based on simplicity, which is very appealing to me. The insert design is also very clean and sober and well thought through. Some might find this boring, but I really like it, as it gets rid of distractions and focuses on the important things. One small example: the notebook pages are numbered, so that you can refer to your notes of a particular appointment in the calendar part. They are also micro-perforated so that you can easily pass on notes.

As a matter of fact, the X47 system comes – for me – pretty close to perfection. Of course, opinions will vary on this issue as purposes and habits will be different and there will be people out there who really can’t work with this system.

I only have two quite minor issues with this planner:

1. You cannot insert reference pages / papers in your planner aside in one of the pockets. I would really love to see some sort of “binder booklet” in which you can add your own reference materials.
2. The pen loop is FAR too small for the Rotring (http://www.rotring.de) pens that I normally use, which is a real pity.

For the details, please have a look at my video on YouTube and should you have any questions regarding this, please feel free to contact me – or X47 for that matter – anytime!

Write to you again you soon!
